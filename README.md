# Secure File Storage and Sharing Solution  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains the architectural design and implementation plan for a secure, scalable, and cost-effective file storage and sharing platform. The platform leverages AWS services to enable users to upload, store, and share files ranging from small documents to large media files with high performance and security.  

---

## **Features**  
- **File Storage:** Utilizes Amazon S3 for secure and scalable file storage.  
- **File Sharing:** Supports temporary file access using pre-signed URLs for secure sharing.  
- **Global Content Delivery:** Integrated Amazon CloudFront for fast file access with low latency.  
- **Security:**  
  - Data encryption at rest using Server-Side Encryption (SSE).  
  - Data encryption in transit via HTTPS.  
  - Fine-grained access controls using IAM roles and policies.  
- **File Processing:**  
  - AWS Lambda for automated metadata generation upon file upload.  
  - S3 Multi-Part Upload for efficient handling of large files.  
- **Monitoring and Auditing:**  
  - CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.  
  - CloudTrail for logging user activity and ensuring compliance.
